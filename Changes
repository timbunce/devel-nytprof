=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 4.03 (svn 1316) 19th June 2010

  Fixed another nytprofhtml performance problem for profiles with
    many files/evals. Much faster merging of evals now.

  Fixed links from block/sub level report pages to string eval report
    pages.  RT#58284

  Restored ordering of line - block - sub links on index page.

  Clarified that saving the source code of string evals requires perl

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 4.00 (svn 1291) 8th June 2010

Major changes:

  Added profile reporting of code executed in string evals.
    Each string eval executed gets it's own report page.
    You can 'see' the code that was executed, with profile info.
    String evals may be collapsed/merged in some cases.

  Improved many sub-optimal behaviours related to string evals.

  Subroutine calls that couldn't be associated with a specific line,
    such as calls made by perl to END blocks, are now shown in reports.

  Subroutine definitions that couldn't be associated with a specific file,
    such as xsubs in packages with no perl source, are now shown in reports.

  Enabled savesrc=1 by default.

  The data file format has changed so v3.x files can't be read.
  The Devel::NYTProf::ReadStream interface has also changed.

Other changes:

  Fixed off-by-1 error in number of Files an xsub/opcode was called from.
  Fixed Devel::NYTProf::Apache to work in more situations
    and enable the addpid option by default.
  Fixed that END blocks defined at runtime are included in the profile
    thanks to Nicholas Clark.

  Compilation-only checks (perl -c) can be profiled thanks to Nicholas Clark.
  Improved behaviour for 'duplicate' anon-subs defined in separate
    invocations of a particular string eval.
  Multiple BEGINs (e.g., use) on the same line get distinct names.

  Added --minimal option to nytprofhtml to disable generation of
    graphviz .dot files and block/sub-level statement report files.
  Added automatic detection of calls to POSIX::_exit() by the sub profiler
    so finish_profile() gets called and a usable profile is produced.
  Added posix_exit=1 option to do the same thing (in a different way)
    when the sub profiler is not being used (i.e., subs=0).

Documentation Changes:

  Sequences of blank lines are skipped in generated reports.
    Relevant for savesrc mode in which perl doesn't store pod sections.
  Corrected typos in nytprofhtml docs thanks to chocolate@cpan.org.
  Documented how to use Devel::NYTProf::Apache with virtual hosts that
    use the PerlOptions +Parent or +Clone configuration.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 3.11 (svn 1171) 12th March 2010

  Fixed assorted issues on Windows thanks to Jan Dubois.
  Fixed assorted issues 64bit systems thanks to Jan Dubois.

  Refactored I/O to create an API that encapsulates the data
    file format, thanks to Nicholas Clark.
  Updated and optimized nytprofmerge to use the new API
    yielding a significant speed boost, thanks to Nicholas Clark.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 3.02 (svn 1094) 5th March 2010

  Fixed handling of usecputime=1 option and updated
    docs to note the significant limitations.
  Fixed association of XS subs to source files
    in some edge cases thanks to Nicholas Clark.
  Fixed nytprofmerge edge cases thanks to Nicholas Clark.

    many thanks to Markus Peter.
  Added assorted optimizations thanks to Nicholas Clark.

  Changed subroutine profiler to be slightly more efficient.
  Changed some tests to be more informative on failure.
  Changed nytprofhtml to be smarter when source isn't available.
  Changed nytprofhtml to show sort arrow on sortable tables.

  Removed Devel::NYTProf::PgPLPerl module. That's now a separate
    PostgreSQL::PLPerl::NYTProf distribution.

  Updated docs to include a note about timing on Windows.
  Updated docs to include a section about making NYTProf faster.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 3.01 (svn r1005) 28th Dec 2009

  Fixed (removed) use of vfscanf() which broke on Windows.
  Fixed version number in nytprofmerge.

  Added documentation to nytprofcg and nytprofmerge.

  Updated NYTProf docs, including noting major contributors.
  Updated docs to fix assorted typos, thanks to Jonathan Yu.
  Updated nytprofcsv documentation.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 3.00 (svn r998) 24th Dec 2009

  Note: The file format has changed. Old files can't be read.

  Fixed (rare) overflow bug for 32bit perls.
  Fixed discarding of (rare) negative intervals.
  Fixed risk of infinite recursion if trace enabled and
    $SIG{__WARN__} was set to a code reference.
  Fixed subroutine recursion depth measurement.
  Fixed missing embedded eval source code for some older perls.
  Fixed assorted compiler warnings for various configurations.

  Changed ReadStream SUB_LINE_RANGE tag to SUB_INFO.

  Added log=F option to write trace log to a file.
  Added warning when reading a file with a minor version higher
    than expected.

  Added slowops=N option which enables profiling of potentially slow
    perl opcodes (e.g., system calls and regexs). They're treated like xsubs.
    slowops=0 disables profiling of 'slowops'
    slowops=1 puts timings into one package ("CORE::", eg CORE::sleep)
    slowops=2 (the default) puts timings into into the package that made the
    call, e.g., "Foo::CORE:sleep" (note the single colon).

  Added sigexit=1 option to enable a useable profile when the process
    exits due to a signals (catches INT HUP PIPE BUS SEGV by default)
    Can also do sigexit=TRAP,ABRT,SYS,... to hook specific signals.
    Thanks to Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp for the seed of this idea.

  Added forkdepth=N option to enable profiling to be turned off after N
    generations of fork().

  Added nameevals=0 and nameanonsubs=0 options to make NYTProf less
    visible to code that may assume the default perl naming behaviour.
    Note that using these will limit the usefulness of reports.

  Added initial support for profiling PostgreSQL PL/Perl code
    via Devel::NYTProf::PgPLPerl module.

  Added nytprofmerge utility:
    Reads multiple nytprof data files and writes a new merged file.
    Many thanks to Nicholas Clark!

Changes to subroutine profiler:

  Rewritten. Captures more data more accurately and robustly.
  Added profiling of calls to xsubs that exit via an exception.
  Added profiling of goto &sub;
  Added recording the name of the calling subroutine to enable proper
    linking of call trees. Previously only the calling file and line
    were recorded. (This is more significant than it sounds :)
  Added docs describing how the subroutine profiler works.
  Multiple BEGIN blocks (including "use") within a package are now
    distinguished by appending the number of the line they start on
    (for perl 5.8.9+ and 5.10.1+)

Changes to nytprofhtml:

  Added interactive treemap view of package and subroutine times.
    Left-click to zoom in (drill-down) one level, right-click to zoom out.

  Added generation of GraphViz dot language files to visualize
    the call graph. A top-level link on the index page provides an
    inter-package graph, and per-source-file links provide a graph
    of sub calls in to, out of, and between the subs in the file.
    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz

  Added columns to the main source code reports to show
    a count of sub calls and time spent in those calls.

  Assorted cosmetic improvements.
  Changed colors on report pages to be less saturated.


=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.10 (svn r774) 18th June 2009

  Fixed call count for XSubs that was one too high.
  Fixed enable_profile() after fork thanks to delamonpansie
    http://code.google.com/p/perl-devel-nytprof/issues/detail?id=15
  Fixed to use correct scripts during test and so avoid permissions
    issues, thanks to David Golden.
  Fixed spurious "Unable to determine line number" warnings
    when using options like -p, -n, -Mfoo.

  Changed enable_profile() to discard the time spent since
    profile was disabled.
  Changed NYTPROF env var parsing to allow backslash to escape
    colons, for Windows, thanks to Joshua ben Jore.

  Added license, homepage, bugtracker, repository and MailingList
    resources to META.yml thanks to Michael G Schwern.
  Added nytprofcg utility to generate callgrind data for
    viewing via Kcachegrind, thanks to Chia-liang Kao.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.09 (svn r733) 29th March 2009

  Added support for modules using AutoLoader, e.g., POSIX & Storable,
    to fix the "Unable to open '... (autosplit into ...)'" warnings.
  Fixed report filename generation to remove colons,
    for Windows, reported by Adam Kennedy in rt bug #43798.
  Fixed report filename generation to remove dots, for VMS.
  Fixed savesrc option which wasn't safe and reliable.
  Added missing t/test22-strevala.t to MANIFEST.
  Extended testing to exercise compress and savesrc options.

Ported to VMS, thanks to Peter (Stig) Edwards:

  Renamed t/\d\d.test.t    files to t/\d\d_test.t 
          t/test*.pm.x     files to t/test*.pm_x 
          t/test*fork.\d.* files to t/test*fork-\d.*
          .js and .css     file to only have one period/dot
    for greater portability.  VMS ODS-2 files can only have
    one period/dot.
  Added t/92-file_port.t as a developer-only and
    request-using-ENV test, to help maintain portable files,
    currently .indent.pro and .perltidyrc fall foul of portable
    filename characters as defined by ANSI C and perlport.
  NYTProf.xs's open_output_file use mode 'wb' and not 'wbx'
    to avoid unsupported error when on VMS.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.08 (svn r685) 15th Feb 2009

Core:

  Added optimize=0 option to disable the perl optimizer
    so you can see more accurate statement execution counts
    for some kinds of constructs.

  Added savesrc=1 option to copy source code into the profile
    so reports are not affected by changes to the source files.

  Added ability for DB::enable_profile() to specify a new file
    for profile data to be written to.

Reporting:

  Time spent within nested string evals is accounted for.

  Fixed searching @INC for source files for reports.

  Dramatically increased performance of nytprofhtml
    relative to the 2.07 version.

  Many tables in html reports are sortable by clicking on header columns
    (requires JavaScript, uses jQuery and tablesorter.js)

  Statement timings are now shown as integers in appropriate
    units: seconds, milliseconds, microseconds or nanoseconds.

  Hovering over times in subroutine or file summary tables
    now shows the percentage time.

  Added tables showing timings rolled up per package name depth.

  Improved HTML conformance thanks to Leland Johnson.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.07 (svn r583) 1st Nov 2008

Core:

  NOTE: The file format has changed. Files from 2.04 and 2.05
  can still be read by this version.

  Subroutine inclusive time no longer counts time
    spent recursed into the same subroutine. That time is
    now recorded separately, along with the max recursion depth.

  Added stmts=0 option to disable the statement profiler
    so just the subroutine profiler runs. That reduces the
    profiler overhead and gives you much smaller data files.

  Now builds on Windows, with thanks to Jan Dubois!

  Removed use of vfscanf() to improve portability to Windows
    and old unix systems, thanks to Jan Dubois.

  The profiler takes more care to avoid changing $!.

Reports:

  Fixed significant error in time reported as spent in a subroutine,
    which was showing the sum of the inclusive and exclusive time
    instead of just the inclusive time.

  Subroutine calls made within string evals are now shown in reports.
  Subroutine caller details now includes calls from within string evals.

  XS subs (xsubs) are now automatically associated with a source
    file that defines normal subs in the same package.
  Callers and timing information for xsubs are now shown at the
    bottom of the corresponding source file.
  References to xsubs in reports now include a working link
    if the xsub is in a package that contains profiled perl code.

  The html global subroutine index pages no longer list subs that
    were never called.

  Assorted report formating enhancements thanks to Gisle Aas.

  Exclusive and Inclusive time column positions have been switched
    to be consistent with how the times are presented elsewhere.

  nytprofhtml includes a --open option to open the generated html

Documentation:

  Greatly expanded description of the clocks used for profiling
    and their issues, especially on multi-processor systems.

Other:

  Added Devel::NYTProf::ReadStream module which provides a perl
    interface for reading the raw profile data, thanks to Gisle Aas.


=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.05 (svn r498) 8th Oct 2008

  Fixed alteration of $! during profiling thanks to Slaven Rezic.
  Fixed clock_gettime() clock selection to fallback to CLOCK_REALTIME
    if CLOCK_MONOTONIC is not available, e.g, on linux 2.4.
  Fixed error when application ends after DB::disable_profile().

  Added some docs to Devel::NYTProf::Apache
  Added clock=N option to enable user to select the clock.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.04 (svn r483) 1st Oct 2008

  Fixed rare divide-by-zero error in reporting code.
  Fixed rare core dump in reporting code.
  Fixed detection of #line directives to be more picky.
  Fixed some compiler warnings thanks to Richard Foley.

  Added on-the-fly ~90% zip compression thanks to Nicholas Clark.
    Reduces data file size per million statements executed
    from approx ~13MB to ~1MB (depends on code being profiled).

  Added extra table of all subs sorted by inclusive time.

  No longer warns about '/loader/0x800d8c/...' synthetic file
    names perl assigns reading code from a CODE ref in @INC

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.03 (svn r405) 15 Aug 2008

  NOTES:
  1. File format changed. Old profiles can't be read.
  2. Perl 5.8.1 is the oldest perl version supported.

  Fixed accounting for time spent executing subs that were
    compiled in string evals.
  Fixed risk of file corruption by names containing newlines.

  Changed to also profile compile-time activity by default.
  Improved formating of stats for subs called by a statement.

  Added start=begin|init|end|no option to NYTPROF env var.
  Added addpid=1 option to NYTPROF env var.
  Added support for .pmc files.
  Added detection of #line directives in source code
    currently just warns that they are not handled.

  Known issues:
  Perl 5.8.8 can report garbage file names for XS subs.
  (Perl 5.8.6 and 5.10 don't seem to have this problem.)
  Where a subroutine is called from code compiled in a string
  evals, the artificial "eval file names" are not yet merged.
  (You're unlikely to notice this obscure case anyway.)

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.02 (svn r361) 24 Jul 2008

  Fixed colors to use the median (not average) deviation from the median value.
  Fixed sub name resolution to work in more, perhaps all, unusual cases.

  Improved accuracy of subroutine timing by deducting statement measurement overheads.
  Improved readability of subroutine caller lists.
  Replaced use of fpurge() with a more portable approach.

  Added exclusive subroutine time (time in sub excluding subs it called).
  Added recording of xsub filenames (i.e. DBI.c)
  Added use of clock_gettime(), if available, for 100ns resolution.
    Uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC or else CLOCK_REALTIME. Thanks to Steve Peters.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.01

  Fixed and unified module version numbers.

=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.00

  Major changes. Much extra functionality and performance.
  See http://blog.timbunce.org/2008/07/15/nytprof-v2-a-major-advance-in-perl-profilers/

=head2 Changes in and before 1.50

  1.50  ? ? ? 0:00:00 2008
    - Major revision to include Tim Bunce's call scope statistics features,
        code/doc refactoring, optimizations and bug fixes.
    - Fixes major issues with profiling code that forks.

  1.13  Wed Mar 26 9:35:00 2008
    - Fixed RedHat EL bug - %f isn't the C format for floating-point for RHEL
        Changed Reader.pm to warn-and-continue instead of dieing when a source 
        file cannot be found. (the file will be skipped). Feature by request.
        Makefile.PL changes by tim.bunce - fix warning on LICENSE key when 
        installed by older versions of MakeMaker. Added vim modeline.

  1.12  Tue Mar 25 11:05:00 2008
    - Fixed YET ANOTHER test failure caused by trivial differences between v5.6
        and v5.8.x. Added test15 that only executes on <5.8 and test06 now only
        runs on >5.8.0

  1.11  Mon Mar 24 11:26:00 2008
    - Rewrote test06 and test 13 only. No functionality changes. There is a Perl
        debugger bug. In perl >5.6 closing "}" in empty loops get execution
        counts for some reason. This caused 5.6 to fail 'make test' 
        needlessly. (5.6 actually handles it better and 5.8 & 5.10). So I 
        changed the code to avoid empty loop tests, which are no more useful 
        than loops with code in them. 
        *test06 now tests only loops - foreach, while and do-while loops. 
        *test13 now tests only forms of eval, and eval failures - loops removed

  1.10  Web Mar 19 21:02:00 2008
    - Another CPAN versioning fix. Hopefully the last!!!
    - Added Makefile.pl check to report unsupported OS on Win32

  0.09  Wed Mar 19 13:05:00 2008
    - Fixed broken CPAN version numbering
    - Implemented malloc() fix by Tim Bunce (tim.bunce@gmail.[nospam]com
    - Wrote a better eval test, now covers all uses ("", perlcode, {...})
    - Fixed AutoSplit file source problem
    - Wrote AutoSplit/AutoLoader tests (test14)
    - Bugs fixed (hopefully)  33889, 34234, 33991, 33878

  0.08  Mon Mar 10 17:35:00 2008
    - Added #define to fix missing linkage for OutCopFile (Perl <5.8.0 fix)
    - Added test12, basic do script test
    - Moved min version to 5.6.0 again (another attempt)

  0.05  Fri Mar 7 10:29:00 2008
    - Changed XS code to compile clean with -ansi and -pedantic
    - Removed `cont' on file argument to process due to XS error in Perl 5.6
    - Added code to Makefile.PL so that header sources are run through the C 
        pre-processor (if available) as a potential fix for some BSD systems.

  0.03  Thu Mar 6 09:12:00 2008
    - Fixed a VERY tricky bug some people had encountered. Scalar references to 
        code that is evaled at runtime will cause divide-by-zero error IF the
        reference was declared in a BEGIN {...} and used outside of a BEGIN. 
        (The debugger/profiler can't see what happens in a BEGIN)
    - Added test case for above issue as test11
    - Fixed (i hope) the OSX segfault when using a re-malloc'd pointer that was 
        once freed.
    - Changed XS to compile cleanly with -Wall.
    - Adopted versioning scheme: modules/files start at 1.0 and the distro will
        continue from 0.0, thus making mixed versions less confusing.
    - Enabled the debugging switch so that NYTProf can be used in the form
        perl -MDevel::NYTProf code.pl (BUT this is ALPHA quality -- may bork)
    - Minor cleanup to Makefile.PL

  0.02  Wed Mar 5 14:20:00 2008
    - fixed a bunch of minor problems with the distribution that caused cpan
        warnings and also cause the exe scripts to not be installed
    - now a working cpan distro

  0.01  Tue Feb 12 10:34:03 2008
