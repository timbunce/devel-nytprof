=head2 Changes in Devel::NYTProf 2.02

  Fixed colors to use the median (not average) deviation from the median value.

  Changed subroutine timing to deduct statement measurement overheads.

  Added exclusive subroutine time (time in sub excluding subs it called).
  Added use of clock_gettime(), if available, for 100ns resolution.
    Uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC or else CLOCK_REALTIME. Thanks to Steve Peters.

=head2 Changes in and before 1.50

	1.50  ? ? ? 0:00:00 2008
		- Major revision to include Tim Bunce's call scope statistics features,
				code/doc refactoring, optimizations and bug fixes.
		- Fixes major issues with profiling code that forks.

	1.13	Wed Mar 26 9:35:00 2008
		- Fixed RedHat EL bug - %f isn't the C format for floating-point for RHEL
				Changed Reader.pm to warn-and-continue instead of dieing when a source 
				file cannot be found. (the file will be skipped). Feature by request.
				Makefile.PL changes by tim.bunce - fix warning on LICENSE key when 
				installed by older versions of MakeMaker. Added vim modeline.

	1.12	Tue Mar 25 11:05:00 2008
		- Fixed YET ANOTHER test failure caused by trivial differences between v5.6
				and v5.8.x.	Added test15 that only executes on <5.8 and test06 now only
				runs on >5.8.0

	1.11	Mon Mar 24 11:26:00 2008
		- Rewrote test06 and test 13 only. No functionality changes. There is a Perl
				debugger bug. In perl >5.6 closing "}" in empty loops get execution
				counts for some reason.	This caused 5.6 to fail 'make test' 
				needlessly.	(5.6 actually handles it better and 5.8 & 5.10). So I 
				changed the code to avoid empty loop tests, which are no more useful 
				than loops with code in them.	
				*test06 now tests only loops - foreach, while and do-while loops. 
				*test13 now tests only forms of eval, and eval failures - loops removed

	1.10	Web Mar 19 21:02:00 2008
		- Another CPAN versioning fix. Hopefully the last!!!
		- Added Makefile.pl check to report unsupported OS on Win32

	0.09	Wed Mar 19 13:05:00 2008
		- Fixed broken CPAN version numbering
		- Implemented malloc() fix by Tim Bunce (tim.bunce@gmail.[nospam]com
		- Wrote a better eval test, now covers all uses ("", perlcode, {...})
		- Fixed AutoSplit file source problem
		- Wrote AutoSplit/AutoLoader tests (test14)
		- Bugs fixed (hopefully)	33889, 34234, 33991, 33878

	0.08	Mon Mar 10 17:35:00 2008
		- Added #define to fix missing linkage for OutCopFile (Perl <5.8.0 fix)
		- Added test12, basic do script test
		- Moved min version to 5.6.0 again (another attempt)

	0.05	Fri Mar 7 10:29:00 2008
		- Changed XS code to compile clean with -ansi and -pedantic
		- Removed `cont' on file argument to process due to XS error in Perl 5.6
		- Added code to Makefile.PL so that header sources are run through the C 
				pre-processor (if availible) as a potential fix for some BSD systems.

	0.03	Thu Mar 6 09:12:00 2008
		- Fixed a VERY tricky bug some people had encountered. Scalar references to 
				code that is evaled at runtime will cause divide-by-zero error IF the
				reference was declared in a BEGIN {...} and used outside of a BEGIN. 
				(The debugger/profiler can't see what happens in a BEGIN)
		- Added test case for above issue as test11
		- Fixed (i hope) the OSX segfault when using a re-malloc'd pointer that was 
				once freed.
		- Changed XS to compile cleanly with -Wall.
		- Adopted versioning scheme: modules/files start at 1.0 and the distro will
				continue from 0.0, thus making mixed versions less confusing.
		- Enabled the debugging switch so that NYTProf can be used in the form
				perl -MDevel::NYTProf code.pl (BUT this is ALPHA quality -- may bork)
		- Minor cleanup to Makefile.PL

	0.02	Wed Mar 5 14:20:00 2008
		- fixed a bunch of minor problems with the distribution that caused cpan
				warnings and also cause the exe scripts to not be installed
		- now a working cpan distro

	0.01	Tue Feb 12 10:34:03 2008
		- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
				-A -n Devel::NYTProf
